In today’s dynamic educational landscape requires an effective communication between educational institutions, parents, and students is paramount for fostering student success and wellbeing. For this project I visited an school named  Crescent English School located at Kalaranthiri,Koduvally,Calicut and founded the problems which I have mentioned.So I am doing this project as a remedy for those problems.It introduces an integrated Student Information System (SIS) that serves as a comprehensive platform for managing various aspects of a student’s academic journey. 
The SIS encompasses four key functionalities:  
• Student attendance tracking  
• Student work daily updates  
• Student performance analytics with personalized 
suggestions. 
The SIS enables real-time attendance tracking, notifying parents of their child’s presence, fosters transparency through daily work updates, and evaluates student performance for tailored suggestions. Moreover, it facilitates efficient communication channels among Management , parents, and students, fostering a collaborative 
environment. The system’s advanced analytics not only assess academic metrics but also identify students’ strengths and areas requiring improvement. Then the management can provide targeted support and offer personalized recommendations, which may include additional study resources or extracurricular activities aligned with the student’s interests and aspirations. This holistic approach aims to improve student outcomes, strengthen parent-school partnerships, and create more supportive and productive learning environment for all stakeholders. By harnessing technology to provide real-time information and personalized guidance. SIS stands at the forefront of enhancing educational experiences and nurturing the future success of students.
